## Setup

To get started with TypeMaster, you need to set up your API key for OpenAI, which powers our style suggestions. Please note that you must use a key linked to an account with a paid subscription as our platform utilizes OpenAI's GPT 3.5 Turbo:

1. **Open the Extension**: Click on the TypeMaster icon in your browser's extension tray.
2. **Navigate to Setup**: You will be greeted by a setup page asking for your OpenAI API key.

## Extension in Action

Once you have TypeMaster set up, using it is as simple as highlighting text on any web page. Just select the text you've written and click on the TypeMaster icon to open the side panel. You can also access TypeMaster by right-clicking on highlighted text and choosing "Open side panel". Here, you'll see:
